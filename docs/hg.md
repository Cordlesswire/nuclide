Local changes to files in a Mercurial repository will be reflected in Atom's file tree and gutter
UI as Atom does natively for Git repositories:

![Mercurial File Tree colouring](/static/images/docs/MercurialFileTreeLineColours.png)

Nuclide colorizes the gutter beside any lines that have been modified, added, or removed. It also
adds color indicators in the file tree to reflect changes - new files are green, modified files
are orange, and ignored files are dark grey.
